                    =====================================

Prerequisites:
--------------

Perl version 5.000 or higher, a C compiler capable of the ANSI C standard (!)
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Preliminary steps for use with Perl prior to version 5.002:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Edit the file "Makefile.PL" and change the line

    'VERSION_FROM'      => 'Vector.pm',
to
    'VERSION'           => '5.1',

Then edit the file "Vector.pm" and change the line

    bootstrap Bit::Vector $VERSION;
to
    bootstrap Bit::Vector;

Also edit the file "t/00____version.t" and change the line

    use Bit::Vector 5.1;
to
    use Bit::Vector;

Finally, edit the file "Vector.xs" and delete the line

    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE


How to install it:
------------------

Please unpack and build this package OUTSIDE the Perl source and distribution
tree!!

 1) Change directory to the directory that has been created by unpacking this
    package ("cd Bit-Vector-5.1/").

 2) Type "perl Makefile.PL" (or whatever the name and path of your Perl 5
    binary is).

    This will create a "Makefile" with the appropriate parameters for your
    system (for instance, where the install directories are, and so on).

 3) Type "make".

    This will create a dynamically linkable library file that will be linked
    to Perl later, at runtime, provided your system supports dynamic linking.

    Please refer to the MakeMaker documentation for instructions on how
    to build a new Perl with statically linked libraries (invoke "perldoc
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker" for this), if your system does NOT support dynamic
    linking!

    Should you encounter any compiler warnings or errors (like the redefi-
    nition of certain types already defined by your system), please contact
    me via mail at <sb@sdm.de>, sending me your compiler output (both STDOUT
    and STDERR). Thank you!

    ======================================================================
    Be aware that you need a C compiler which supports ANSI C in order to
    successfully compile this package!
    ======================================================================

    Also note that problems may arise with the c89 compiler of HP, although
    it allegedly supports ANSI C!

    I recommend the GNU gcc compiler, which is available for free on the
    Internet.

    (HP users are strongly recommended to install the GNU assembler GAS
    first before installing GNU gcc)

    Should you get the error messages

    Vector.c: 15: Unable to find include file 'EXTERN.h'.
    Vector.c: 16: Unable to find include file 'perl.h'.
    Vector.c: 17: Unable to find include file 'XSUB.h'.

    then edit the file "Makefile.PL" and change the line

    'INC'       => '',     # e.g., '-I/usr/include/other'

    in such a way that it points to your Perl 5 distribution tree, e.g.,

    'INC'       => '-I/usr/ctr/dlt/private/perl/perl5.003',

    or the like, and start over with the generation of the "Makefile" at 2).

 4) Now issue "make test".

    The output should look somewhat like this:

    PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /sw/bin/perl -I./blib/arch -I./blib/lib
    -I/sw/pkg/perl/lib/i386-freebsd/5.00403 -I/sw/pkg/perl/lib
    -e 'use Test::Harness qw(&runtests $verbose); $verbose=0;
    runtests @ARGV;' t/*.t
    t/00____version.....ok
    t/01________new.....ok
    t/02____destroy.....ok
    t/03_operations.....ok
    t/04__functions.....ok
    t/05_____primes.....ok
    t/06_____subset.....ok
    t/07____compare.....ok
    t/08_____resize.....ok
    t/09_parameters.....ok
    t/10__intervals.....ok
    t/11______shift.....ok
    t/12_____string.....ok
    t/13__increment.....ok
    t/14______empty.....ok
    t/15________add.....ok
    t/16___subtract.....ok
    t/28__chunklist.....ok
    t/30_overloaded.....ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=19,  Tests=67061, 173 secs (116.80 cusr  5.01 csys = 121.80 cpu)

    (Note that the exact number of tests will depend on the number of bits
     of a machine word/an unsigned long on your system!)

 5) At last, type "make install".

 6) Now you can run the "primes.pl" demo program from the "examples" sub-
    directory, for instance. Start it with "perl primes.pl" (or whatever
    the name and path of your Perl 5 binary is).

    It will ask you to enter a number which will serve as an upper limit for
    the calculation of all prime numbers up to that limit, using the algorithm
    known as "The Sieve of Erathostenes".

    On my machine (SUN SPARCstation 20/61), calculating all the prime numbers
    up to one million takes about 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes (depending
    on the load) when the algorithm is programmed in Perl. If the internal
    method "Primes()" is used instead (implemented in C), the same machine
    only takes about 1 second for this task.

 7) Share and enjoy!
